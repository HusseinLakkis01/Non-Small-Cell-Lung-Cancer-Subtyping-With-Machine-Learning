Early diagnosis and prognosis of the type of cancer have become a necessity in cancer research, which can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. Scientists have used different methods, such as early-stage screening, to detect types of cancer before they cause symptoms. Besides, they have developed new strategies for the early prediction of cancer treatment outcomes. With the advent of new technologies in the field of medicine, large amounts of data on cancer have been collected and are available to the medical research community.
