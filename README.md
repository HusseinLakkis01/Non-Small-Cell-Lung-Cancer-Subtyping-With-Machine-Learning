Early diagnosis and prognosis of the type of cancer have become a necessity in cancer research, which can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. Scientists have used different methods, such as early-stage screening, to detect types of cancer before they cause symptoms. Besides, they have developed new strategies for the early prediction of cancer treatment outcomes. With the advent of new technologies in the field of medicine, large amounts of data on cancer have been collected and are available to the medical research community.

Machine learning approaches are sufficient to assess a clinical diagnosis. Their final aim is to obtain trained models that predict the type and developmental character of malignant growth by using one or more classification attributes. Such algorithms can be used by doctors as an additional method to handle large amounts of patient data for diagnostic purposes. 

That being said, this code attempts to build accurate machine learning models that would classify NSCLCs into the two major subtypes.
